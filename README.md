# TutorGPT

In this repository we will explore how to build a no-code, local and open-source Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) chatflow.
We will explain how to build each component using [Flowise AI](https://flowiseai.com/).

This project was part of the master program study Digital Business Engineering at the Herman-Hollerith-Zentrum (HHZ) in the lecture Applied Machine Learning. For the purpose of our project we have built an AI Tutor for the lecture of Distributed System. Our tutor answers questions about the lecture slides in an engaging and motivating tone.

# Pre-Requirements 
Before you can import the chatflow you need to have Flowise and Ollama installed. 

## What is Flowise?

Flowise is an open source low-code tool for developers to build customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents. Through a simple drag-and-drop UI approach it allows you to quickly prototype LLM applications. Flowise allows you to built applications based on LLM frameworks LangChain and LlamaIndex. We decided to use the LangChain components, because LlamaIndex is still a Beta Version in Flowise.

## How to install Flowise?
Since we wanted to use all components of our system locally, we deployed Flowise locally using NPM. For other deployment options head over to their [documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) or [Github](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise).

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (Node v18.15.0 or v20)
2. Open terminal through cmd and install Flowise
```npm install -g flowise```
3. After installing start Flowise in the terminal
```npx flowise start```
4. Open: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
> [!TIP]
> Download flowise_temp.bat file. Executing this file with automatically start and open Flowise.
5. Update Flowise:
```npm update -g flowise```

## What is Ollama?

Ollama is an open-source project that serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on your local machine. It supports a variety of models, including Llama3, Mistral, Gemma etc...

## How to setup Ollama?

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for the OS of your choice.
2. Install ollama.exe
3. Open terminal through cmd and pull [models](https://ollama.com/library) of your choice from Ollama. For our project we compared Google´s Small Language Models [gemma:2b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma:2b), [gemma:7b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma:7b) and [gemma2:9b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2:9b). As an embedding model we used [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text).

```ollama pull gemma:2b```

```ollama pull gemma:7b```

```ollama pull gemma2:9b```

```ollama pull nomic-embed-text```

4. After you have pulled the models you want, you can run them using the ollama run command. Use the following syntax to run a specific model, in this example we will run the small language model gemma:2b:

```ollama run gemma:2b```

5. To stop a running model in your terminal, use Ctrl + d or /bye.

#  Importing the chatflow
After setting up Flowise, Ollama and pulling the models successfully you are ready to start with Flowise using local models. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always make sure Ollama is running in the background. Open [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/) and it should say "Ollama is running". Flowise should be running in a cmd window as well.

1. On [http://localhost:3000/chatflows](http://localhost:3000/chatflows) click "Add New" on the top right corner to create a blank chatflow
2. Download TutorGPT.json from this repository.
3. Now you should see a blank canvas. We are going to import our chatflow by clicking on the settings icon in the top right corner. Press "Load Chatflow" and import "TutorGPT.json".
4. Save the chatflow

# The Architectural Flow

## Indexing
The architecture begins with **PDF** document loader, where we will upload all the lecture slides. The slides are being processed by a **Recursive Character Text Splitter**, which breaks down the documents into manageable chunks, ensuring no information is lost by using a specified chunk size of 250 characters and a chunk overlap of 25 characters. Next these document text chunks are being encoded into vectors through our embedding model [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text). This is possible thanks to the Ollama Embeddings module. Embeddings are crucial for our RAG-chatflow, since it enables the system to retrieve relevant information based on the vectorized user question. The Base URL is set to http://localhost:11434, since this is where we connect Ollama to our flow.


> [!WARNING]
> Check if MMap is activated under "Additional Parameters". This needs to be turned on!
The generated embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, which allows quick retrieval based on similarity searches. 

Later on after finishing all the components and saving the flow we can create the embeddings by clicking on the database icon "Upsert vector database" on the top right corner beside the chat icon. Depending on your hardware and size of the documents this could take some time. Remember to add your local file path, where the vector store should be saved.

## Retrieval
The **FAISS** module also contains a vector store retriever, **FAISS** retriever. Here the retriever will perform the similarity search between the user question and the document chunks. Under "Additional Paramaters" we have set the Top-K results to 3, which means it will fetch the top-3 closest documents to the user question. The **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain** integrates these components to deliver a seamless question-and-answer experience. It uses the vector store retriever to fetch relevant documents. The **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain** also allows us to change the models behaviour by defining a system prompt. This is where we inserted our "TutorGPT" prompt. Under "Additional Parameters" you can change the response prompt (=System prompt).

> [!WARNING]
> The response prompt always needs the variable {context}. This is where the Top-K retrieved results are injected.

## Generation


The **ChatOllama** module plays a central role in managing the interactive aspect of the system. It uses the top-3 documents to provide responses to user queries. Here we define the model we want to use and set the models temperature value to 0.3. Increasing the temperature of the model will make the model answer more creatively. Again the Base URL is set to http://localhost:11434, since this is where we connect Ollama to our flow.

Now after we have built all the components, created a vector store (or added already existing vector store to path) and saved our flow we are ready to see the chatflow in action! Click on the chat icon and start chatting with TutorGPT!
